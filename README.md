# 30 Days of Code
This is my repository for Hackerrank's 30 Days of Code challenge. I undertook this challenge because my uncle recommended I take it in order to see how I can approach my problem solving. I started on 2021-09-23. I ended on 2021-11-01.

## Conclusion
Throughout this challenge I learned how Binary Trees work and their traversal, studied how to approach recursion, learned how exceptions work in C++, learned the basics of unit testing, learned the basics of RegEx, and learned about Big O notation and a simple way to evaluate the complexity of a given program.
